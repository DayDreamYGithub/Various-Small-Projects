Numeric Warfare is a straightforward calculation game created with Pygame.

Players have to solve simple arithmetic problems. The player starts with 3 HP, while the enemy begins with 10. Each time the player provides an incorrect answer, the player loses 1 HP, whereas a correct answer deducts 1 HP from the enemy. The game ends when the enemy's HP reaches 0, resulting in a player victory. Conversely, if the player's HP reaches 0, the player loses.

The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) and allows for player input.
